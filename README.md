### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jared and I'm an aspiring data scientist ðŸ¤“. My story is that I've been completing my PhD in physics while in my spare time I've been learning as much as I can about data science. This includes everything from taking additional statistics/computer science classes here at Auburn University, obtaining Udacity nanodegrees/certificates, completing my MS in statistics and completing personal projects to learn more about statistics and computer science. My PhD involves applying CFD calculations (that myself and my group has written in C) to wind instruments.

When I first began learning about the field of data science, I simply planned on taking a few statistics classes to get me up to speed, however, upon falling in love with the field (and programming/computer science in general) I decided to take more classes (not too many at once to focus on my dissertation and with a couple of breaks in between) until at this point I've now completed all the course work for my MS in Statistics here @AU. All that I lack is to complete my thesis which I will complete after my PhD in physics. I still have *a lot* to learn, but trust me *I'm just getting started*.

Regarding my GitHub, I have several more projects in the works and will be posting those in the future.

Some things you'll find here on my GitHub:

1. Data related projects:

   - Udacity Nanodegrees Projects (data science related)
   - Projects for my statistics classes here @AU.
   - Odd and end data related projects on topics that I find interesting.

2. Software Engineering/Programming:
   - Projects for programming/computer science projects here @AU
   - Data structures and algorithms interview questions.
   - Projects for my Udacity Nanodegrees/certificates (on more pure programming/software engineering topics).

3. Code related to my personal/portfolio website (coming soon):
   - On second thought I might not post this but I will link my website and describe the stack when I launch it (again, coming soon!).

4. Useful Programs that I've written for my PhD
   - Various bash scripts, C programs etc that I've written that have aided me in my studies in my PhD.
